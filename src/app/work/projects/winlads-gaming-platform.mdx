## Overview

Winlads is a comprehensive gaming and rewards platform designed to serve 5k+ active users with real-time gaming sessions, user point systems, and multi-tenant architecture supporting admin, vendor, and client portals.

## Key Features

- **Microservices Architecture**: Built with 10+ microservices using NestJS, ensuring scalability and maintainability for high-traffic applications.
- **Real-time Gaming Sessions**: Implemented WebSocket connections for live gaming experiences with session management and state synchronization.
- **User Point System**: Developed a comprehensive rewards and points system with Redis caching for fast point calculations and leaderboards.
- **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Created separate portals for administrators, vendors, and clients with role-based access control and data isolation.
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimized PostgreSQL queries and implemented Redis caching, reducing response times by 25% and improving scalability under high-concurrency workloads.

## Technical Implementation

- **Backend**: NestJS with TypeScript for type-safe, scalable API development
- **Frontend**: React with Next.js for server-side rendering and optimal performance
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM for robust data management
- **Caching**: Redis for session management and performance optimization
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: AWS services including S3 for file storage and SQS for message queuing
- **Authentication**: Firebase integration for secure user authentication
- **Containerization**: Docker for consistent deployment across environments

## Performance Achievements

- **25% Response Time Reduction**: Through PostgreSQL query optimization and Redis caching strategies
- **30% Deployment Time Improvement**: Automated CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions and SonarQube
- **High Concurrency Support**: Successfully handling 10k+ daily users with optimized database queries and caching
- **Code Quality Enhancement**: Integrated SonarQube for static analysis, improving overall code quality and maintainability

## Challenges and Solutions

One of the main challenges was managing real-time gaming sessions while maintaining data consistency across multiple microservices. The solution involved implementing a robust event-driven architecture with proper error handling and retry mechanisms. Additionally, optimizing database performance for high-concurrency scenarios required careful indexing strategies and query optimization.

## Outcome

The platform successfully serves 5k+ active users with real-time gaming capabilities, demonstrating the effectiveness of microservices architecture and performance optimization strategies. The implementation of automated CI/CD pipelines and code quality tools has significantly improved the development workflow and deployment efficiency.
